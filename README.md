# rf-cv
A web-based CV built in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. No miserable editing raw html, and no browser-side compiling!

## Vision
Much like how every jedi must learn ot build their own lightsaber, I think everyone applying for a technical position should have a resume styled in something better than a plain word document. I formerly had my resume and cover letter done in LaTeX. While this was cool at the time, it eventually proved troublesome when I wanted to apply for a job without having access to a LaTeX installation.  
I've looked at web-based solutions online, and while many of them are promising, they seem to gravitate towards either precompiled documents based on things like markdown, or on raw HTML. I want something that's formatted the way I like, and that stores data in a sane way, so I'm settling on storing info in a JSON object, with the resume generating data client-side.

### Features
Hopefully, this will be something that other people will want to use as inspiration or as a template, so I want an easy, flexible data structure. I want something that will convert sanely to a PDF. And I want something that can be styled just the way I like it.
